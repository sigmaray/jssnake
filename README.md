# JavaScript Snake

Classic snake with a few improvements.

I have added settings to the game:
* Check if snake goes out of game board. If checkbox is set game will end, otherwise it will continue
* Check if snake collides with itself. If checkbox is set game will end, otherwise it will continue
* Cell num (per each dimension)
* Interval
* Canvas size

Settings are save in web storage.

* Restart: ctrl+r or f5

## Todo

* Move CSS from style attributes into separate file
* Rewrite game in C++/QT
