# JavaScript Snake

Classic snake game with few improvements.

I have added settings to the game:
* Check if snake goes out of game board. If checkbox is set game will end, otherwise it will continue
* Check if snake collides with itself. If checkbox is set game will end, otherwise it will continue
* Cell num (per each dimension)
* Interval
* Canvas size

Settings are save in web storage.

Game is implemented in vanilla JS without using any framework or webpack. package.json is used only for eslint

## How to play
* Pause/unpause: p key
* Move: left/right/up/down keys
* Restart: ctrl+r or f5

## Todo

* Move CSS from style attributes into separate file
* Rewrite game in C++/QT
